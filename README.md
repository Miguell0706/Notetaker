# Celeste's Notetaker App

I designed this notetaking app for my fiance as my first project :)

The app features the ability for a user to create an account to store their notes that have attributes such as a due-time, title, body, pin, and a folder selection to organize certain notes into specific
folders to make it easier to seperate different notes.
